# Photo-Manipulation-Project
A project I completed as a part of ICS4U1. This applies certain effects to an image, filename specified at the bottom of main.py. Example images are provided in the folder. To use a function, uncomment the function at the bottom of main.py. Parameters for certain functions are also provided within the function.
